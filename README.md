# Chess
By Jeffrey A. Camp

SUMMARY:
This is a fully fledged game of chess. This game uses every commonly recognized rule in chess. Rules such as en passant, pawn promotion, and specific piece movement rules are all accounted for in this game.

USE:
In order to use this game, run the main method in class "Main". This will bring up a prompt in the console describing how to write a move, and will ask white to input their movement.

In order to input a move, only 4 numbers are needed (with no spaces or other characters entered). If one wishes to move a piece at x = 0, y = 1 to x = 2, y = 3, this would be input through the following:

0123

Happy chessing.
